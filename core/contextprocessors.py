    return a dict of dicts like this:
    {
        'city':city_name1:{
            'appartment_id':1,'address':address1,'appartment_id':3,'address':address3
            },
        'city:city_name2{
            'appartment_id':2,'address':address2,}  
        },
        ...etc
    }
    so each appartment will be pointed via id to the correct template and later the data for the template can be generated
    
    the navbar should look like
    >city_name1
        >address1 pointing to appartment 1
        >address3 pointing to appartment 3
    >city_name2
        >address2 pointing to appartment 2
    ...etc
